# Pinned versions

Looked up on 2026-10-22. GitHub Actions are pinned to the full commit SHA the release tag resolves to (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<tag> --jq .sha`). Binaries are pinned to an exact version and verified against the sha256 in the project's published checksums file (see `scripts/tools.sh`).

The AWS provider is pinned to 6.70.0 in every root. The initial 6.71.0 target
could not be downloaded in this environment; 6.70.0 is available in verified
local provider caches. Terraform and OpenTofu
must retain their own signed registry-derived lock files; checksum sets can
differ by registry and should never be rewritten by hand. Checkov is pinned to
3.3.30 with transitively hashed requirements in `requirements-checkov.lock`.

Sums are hardcoded for `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-amd64`, `linux-amd64` and `linux-arm64`. Other platforms fail with a clear error.
